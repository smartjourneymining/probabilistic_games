# Testing
All test files are in `test/`.
Data generated by tests are stored in the respective `res` folder.
Tests assume that the original data sets are stored in `data/orig` with their original names.
The path to verifyta needs to be inserted into the single test folders.
Tests were not parameterized to verifyta to protect the default parameter parsing of python unit test frameworks.

To execude all tests: `python3 -m unittest discover .` or run single test files.
